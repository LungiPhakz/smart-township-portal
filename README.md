# Smart Township Portal

Smart Township Portal is a web-based digital platform designed to improve service delivery and communication within township communities. The system enables residents to report service-related issues, track progress, and receive updates, while administrators manage and resolve reported cases efficiently.

This project is currently **under active development** and forms part of my professional growth and practical experience in full-stack web development.
